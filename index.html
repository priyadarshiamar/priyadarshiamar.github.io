    Do Quotas for Marginalized Groups Improve Women’s Representation? Evidence from India’s Village Elections

                   <br>

     Electoral quotas are commonly used to address historical inequalities in descriptive representation. However, these quotas are often implemented along a single dimension of identity, such as gender or ethnicity, despite the fact that inequalities are often multidimensional. This raises an important question: how do quotas focused on a single dimension impact the representation of individuals who sit at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities? I argue that when gender norms are correlated with social status, quotas for marginalized groups may affect women's representation. To empirically test this, the paper examines the impact of quotas for marginalized ethnic groups on women's representation in rural India. I find that in seats with quotas for marginalized ethnic groups, the likelihood of women running for and winning political office is higher than in seats without such quotas. These results suggest that within contexts of discrimination and social hierarchy, status may act as a barrier for women in politics.

    How Electoral Laws Worsen the Candidacy of Minorities in Rural India

      Do electoral laws worsen the candidacy of minorities?  This study examines the impact of India’s “two-child limits” on citizens aspiring to local government offices. These limits compel citizens to choose between family size preference and running for office. By leveraging variations in the law’s adoption across Indian states and employing a difference-in-differences approach, I find that fertility limits reduce the candidacy of Muslims, India's largest religious minority and one of its most marginalized groups. Drawing on primary data from phone surveys with over 500 village politicians in Maharashtra,  I argue that the decline in Muslim candidacy is largely driven by the social costs of deviating from community norms and the externalities due to the imperfect enforcement of these laws. This study underscores how laws restricting political office eligibility based on specific characteristics can create complex tradeoffs for marginalized groups.

    How Voting Systems Affect Political Entry and Exit?
Evidence from Village Elections in India

     In recent years, many countries, particularly in the Global South, have undergone decentralization, transferring power to local bodies. This study focuses on exploring
the consequences of a crucial aspect of decentralized government: the voting systems used to elect executives. While existing scholarship has extensively examined the incentives and performance of the head of government under different voting systems, little attention has been given to non-executive politicians. I argue that if shifts in the voting system affect the de-facto power of a seat, they also influence who enters and who stays in the race. In particular, I examine how these shifts affect candidate nomination (who enters), withdrawal (who exits), and candidacy (who stays) for non-executive political offices, with a focus on consequences for historically marginalized groups. This research seeks to contribute to our understanding of how changes in the value of a seat shapes political dynamics.

As evidenced during the Covid-19 crisis, medical misinformation and false beliefs in alternative treatments may have dramatic consequences, especially among populations with low levels of digital literacy and education. This paper examines whether a sustained, classroom-based media and information literacy intervention can help school children in Bihar, India, to become more discerning consumers of public health information. Collaborating with a branch of Bihar's state government, we developed and fielded a multi-session media literacy RCT across 583 villages, targeting over 12,000 students. Unlike previous anti-misinformation interventions, this project focuses on rural populations, long-term engagement, and adolescents aged 13 to 18. Results from intent-to-treat estimates demonstrate that our intervention had significant impacts on a number of counts: treated students showed heightened ability to discern between true and false information. Notably the intervention also changed health preferences, diminishing reliance on alternative medical approaches and decreasing dependence on untrustworthy sources of news. We are able to detect effects up to 6 weeks post intervention, speaking to the strength of the treatment in changing attitudes long-term. These findings hold significant implications for assessing the efficacy of media literacy measures in light of previous studies that often yield null or mixed results. Our intervention demonstrates continued effectiveness among a particularly challenging sample and difficult context.

Misinformation can have severe consequences, especially among populations with low levels of digital literacy, education, and access to technology. A large body of literature looks at interventions to counter misinformation, but we know less about the message-level attributes that make particular pieces of information attractive. We field an in-person survey in Bihar, India, with a sample of over 6,000 adolescents to determine what factors influence the sharing of (mis)information. Using a conjoint design that randomizes a piece of information's topic, veracity, transmitter identity, original source, and social endorsement -- each in an online or offline setting with an effective sample size of ~36,000 profiles -- our study reveals three key findings. First, respondents relied on source, social endorsement, and veracity cues when deciding what information to share, with a pronounced emphasis on veracity and accuracy. Second, results revealed a bias against Muslim transmitters of information, but not Hindu transmitters, with Muslim sources being penalized more severely for disseminating false information. Finally, while social endorsement plays a significant role in information sharing, its impact varies between online and offline settings, with respondents placing greater importance on reputation-affecting cues when sharing information in-person. These results demonstrate that religious biases can extend to information processing and the online versus offline context that information is received in can significantly alter choices, demonstrating that focusing on less privileged populations in terms of access to information and digital connectivity can reveal striking findings.

  We examine how extreme temperatures affect voter turnout and electoral outcomes in state assembly elections across India. Our findings reveal that both, low and high temperatures on polling days, lead to a decrease in voter turnout. We show that low temperatures exacerbate the gender gap in turnout, while high temperatures affect male and female turnout equally. The decline in turnout due to higher temperatures is especially pronounced when the morning and evening temperatures are high. Moreover, extreme temperatures increase the winner's vote share, indicating reduced electoral competition. We plan to expand our analysis to investigate the effects on winner characteristics and policy performance as a consequence of decreased electoral competition.

             Studies have demonstrated that gender quotas have significant positive implications for society. Yet this evidence sits alongside anecdotal accounts of women merely serving as stand-ins for their male family members. As a step towards reconciling these contradictory claims, we develop low cost behavioral measures of public-facing representation in village councils in India. We define public-facing representation as combination of visibility and accessibility of local politicians to their constituents. Specifically, we use data from two phone audits of politicians in village councils in Bihar (n=697) and Maharashtra (n=520) to test if politicians in gender reserved village councils serve as the first point of contact for the public at large. Next, using a survey of 969 citizens Bihar we measure the extent to which residents can correctly identify the name of their village council president. Our analysis reveals that there exists significant variation in the magnitude of public facing representation in councils reserved for women, but on average women are significantly worse off than their male counterparts. Moreover, we find evidence suggesting that male family members plausibly manage/help in councils reserved. Going forward this project will trace political history within the family, and examine the division of political labor within the household.
